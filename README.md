# Cascade

Cascade is an IRC client written in JavaScript that runs on the
Desktop thanks to [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit).
Although still in a VERY early stage, it is being thought with extensibility in
mind, so that adding features on top of it should be very easy for any
JavaScript developer. The aim is to have a client like HipChat or Campfire, but
that uses the existing IRC infrastructure.

## Run it

In order to run the current version, you should download node-webkit, go to the
folder where you cloned Cascade, and run

```
nw .
```

That should launch Cascade and connect to the #Ubuntu channel on freenode (this
is hardcoded for now. As I said, it is in a veeery early stage).

## Plugins

TBD
