Applications, especially on the web have changed over the years from being a simple static page, to DHTML with animations, to the Ajax revolution.  Each time, we're adding more complexity, more data, and asynchronous behavior to our applications.  How do we manage it all?  How do we scale it?  By moving towards \"Reactive Architectures\" which are event-driven, resilient and responsive.  With the Reactive Extensions, you have all the tools you need to help build these systems.\r\n\r\n## About the Reactive Extensions ##\r\n\r\nThe Reactive Extensions for JavaScript (RxJS) is a set of libraries for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences and fluent query operators modeled after Language Integrated Queries ([LINQ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINQ)). Using RxJS, developers represent asynchronous data streams with Observables, query asynchronous data streams using LINQ operators, and parameterize the concurrency in the asynchronous data streams using Schedulers. Simply put, RxJS = Observables + LINQ + Schedulers.\r\nWhether you are authoring a web-based application in JavaScript or a server-side application in Node.js, you have to deal with asynchronous and event-based programming as a matter of course. Although some patterns are emerging such as the Promise pattern, handling exceptions, cancellation, and synchronization is difficult and error-prone.\r\n\r\nUsing RxJS, you can represent multiple asynchronous data streams (that come from diverse sources, e.g., stock quote, tweets, computer events, web service requests, etc.), and subscribe to the event stream using the Observer object. The Observable notifies the subscribed Observer instance whenever an event occurs.\r\n\r\nBecause observable sequences are data streams, you can query them using standard LINQ query operators implemented by the Observable type. Thus you can filter, project, aggregate, compose and perform time-based operations on multiple events easily by using these static LINQ operators. In addition, there are a number of other reactive stream specific operators that allow powerful queries to be written. Cancellation, exceptions, and synchronization are also handled gracefully by using the methods on the Observable object.\r\n\r\nThis set of libraries include:\r\n\r\n- **rx.js** - core library for ES5 compliant browsers and runtimes\r\n- **rx.compat.js** - core library for older non-ES5 compliant browsers.\r\n- **rx.aggregates.js** - aggregation event processing query operations\r\n- **rx.async.js** - async operationrs such as events, callbacks and promises\r\n- **rx.async.compat.js** - async operationrs such as events, callbacks and promises with support back to IE6\r\n- **rx.binding.js** - binding operators including multicast, publish, publishLast, publishValue, and replay\r\n- **rx.coincidence.js** - reactive coincidence join event processing query operations\r\n- **rx.experimental.js** - experimental operators including imperative operators and forkJoin\r\n- **rx.joinpatterns.js** - join patterns event processing query operations\r\n- **rx.testing.js** - used to write unit tests for complex event processing queries.\r\n- **rx.time.js** - time-based event processing query operations.\r\n- **rx.virtualtime.js** - virtual-time-based schedulers.\r\n\r\n## Why RxJS? ##\r\n\r\nOne question you may ask yourself, is why RxJS?  What about Promises?  Promises are good for solving asynchronous operations such as querying a service with an XMLHttpRequest, where the expected behavior is one value and then completion.  The Reactive Extensions for JavaScript unifies both the world of Promises, callbacks as well as evented data such as DOM Input, Web Workers, Web Sockets.  Once we have unified these concepts, this enables rich composition.\r\n\r\nTo give you an idea about rich composition, we can create an autocompletion service which takes the user input from a text input and then query a service, making sure not to flood the service with calls for every key stroke, but instead allow to go at a more natural pace.\r\n\r\nFirst, we'll reference the JavaScript files, including jQuery, although RxJS has no dependencies on jQuery...\r\n\r\n    <script src=\"http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.js\"></script>\r\n    <script src=\"rx.js\"></script>\r\n    <script src=\"rx.async.js\"></script>\r\n    <script src=\"rx.binding.js\"></script>\r\n    <script src=\"rx.time.js\"></script>\r\n\r\nNext, we'll get the user input from an input, listening to the keyup event by using the `Rx.Observable.fromEvent` method.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar $input = $('#input'),\r\n    $results = $('#results');\r\n\r\n/* Only get the value from each key up */\r\nvar keyups = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(input, 'keyup')\r\n    .map(function (e) {\r\n        return e.target.value;\r\n    })\r\n    .filter(function (text) {\r\n        return text.length > 2;\r\n    });\r\n\r\n/* Now throttle/debounce the input for 500ms */\r\nvar throttled = keyups\r\n    .throttle(500 /* ms */);\r\n\r\n/* Now get only distinct values, so we eliminate the arrows and other control characters */\r\nvar distinct = keyups\r\n    .distinctUntilChanged();\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, let's query Wikipedia!  We'll use the new Promise bindings which will bind to any [Promises A+](https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-spec) implementation through the `Rx.Observable.fromPromise` method.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction searchWikipedia (term) {\r\n    var promise = $.ajax({\r\n        url: 'http://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php',\r\n        dataType: 'jsonp',\r\n        data: {\r\n            action: 'opensearch',\r\n            format: 'json',\r\n            search: encodeURI(term)\r\n        }\r\n    }).promise();\r\n    return Rx.Observable.fromPromise(promise);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce that is created, now we can tie together the distinct throttled input and then query the service.  In this case, we'll call `flatMapLatest` to get the value and ensure that we're not introducing any out of order sequence calls.  \r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar suggestions = distinct\r\n    .flatMapLatest(function (text) {\r\n        return searchWikipedia(text);\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, we call the subscribe method on our observable sequence to start pulling data.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nsuggestions.subscribe( function (data) {\r\n    var res = data[1];\r\n\r\n    /* Do something with the data like binding */\r\n    $results.empty();\r\n\r\n    $.each(res, function (_, value) {\r\n        $('<li>' + value + '</li>').appendTo($results);\r\n    });    \r\n}, function (e) {\r\n    /* handle any errors */\r\n    $results.empty();\r\n\r\n    $('<li>Error: ' + error + '</li>').appendTo($results);    \r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd there you have it!\r\n\r\n##  API Documentation ##\r\n\r\nYou can find the documentation [here](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/tree/master/doc) as well as examples [here](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/tree/master/examples) and plenty of [unit tests](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/tree/master/tests).\r\n\r\n## RESOURCES\r\n\r\n- Contact us\r\n    - [Tech Blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/rxteam) \r\n    - [Twitter @ReactiveX](https://twitter.com/ReactiveX)\r\n    - [Twitter @OpenAtMicrosoft](http://twitter.com/OpenAtMicrosoft)\r\n\r\n- Required Reading\r\n    - [Reactive Manifesto](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/)\r\n\r\n- Podcasts\r\n    - [.NET Rocks #907](http://dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=907)\r\n\r\n- Articles\r\n    - [Your Mouse is a Database](http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2169076)\r\n\r\n- Tutorials\r\n    - [Learn RxJS](http://jhusain.github.io/learnrx/)\r\n    - [RxJS Koans](https://github.com/mattpodwysocki/RxJSKoans)\r\n    - [Rx Workshop](http://rxworkshop.codeplex.com/)\r\n\r\n- Presentations\r\n    - [Don't Cross the Streams - Cascadia.js 2012](http://www.slideshare.net/mattpodwysocki/cascadiajs-dont-cross-the-streams)\r\n    - [Curing Your Asynchronous Blues - Strange Loop 2013](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/StrangeLoop2013)\r\n\r\n- Videos\r\n    - [Hello RxJS - Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/Charles/Introducing-RxJS-Reactive-Extensions-for-JavaScript)\r\n    - [MIX 2011](http://channel9.msdn.com/events/MIX/MIX11/HTM07)\r\n    - [RxJS Today and Tomorrow - Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/Charles/Matthew-Podwysocki-and-Bart-J-F-De-Smet-RxJS-Today-and-Tomorrow)\r\n    - [Cascadia.js 2012](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqBq4uoiG0M)\r\n    - [Reactive Extensions Videos on Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com/Tags/reactive+extensions)\r\n\r\n- Reference Material\r\n    - [Intro to Rx](http://introtorx.com/)\r\n    - [101 Rx Samples Wiki](http://rxwiki.wikidot.com/101samples)\r\n    - [Rx Design Guidelines](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=205219)\r\n    - [Beginners Guide to Rx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/gg577611)\r\n\r\n- Books\r\n    - [Intro to Rx](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-to-Rx-ebook/dp/B008GM3YPM/)\r\n    - [Programming Reactive Extensions and LINQ](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Reactive-Extensions-Jesse-Liberty/dp/1430237473/)\r\n\r\n## GETTING STARTED\r\n\r\nThere are a number of ways to get started with RxJS.
